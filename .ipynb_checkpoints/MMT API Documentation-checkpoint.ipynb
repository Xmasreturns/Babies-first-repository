    "#Mahjong Matchmaking Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "Mahjong Matchmaking Toolkit (MMT) is a set of functions for manipulating player data and seating players based on their past game history. This toolkit can be used to retrieve useful subsets of game data from an external database, as well as to seat players according to a variety of matchmaking techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things you may want to do that MMT can help with:\n",
    "* Aggregate data for a subset of players in a play group\n",
    "* Seat players by minimizing the number of times each person plays against the same opponents\n",
    "* Seat players together with opponents they have not played recently\n",
    "* Visualize data regarding a subset of players in a play group\n",
    "\n",
    "#####Note: This library uses the following release versions:\n",
    "* [Python 2.7.2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/)\n",
    "* [Numpy 1.9.2](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)\n",

    "####1.1 Game data\n",
    "Functions in this package require play data in **`.csv`** format with headers that include **`'GameId'`** and **`'PlayerId'`**. For each of these headers, the respective values should contain only a single datatype and be uniquely identifiable. For example, the following is a pandas [DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) object converted from Example_Data.csv. It contains information for 2 games played, one on April 6th and another on April 12th:\n",
